The actual result may differ based on device settings, environment, usage and other factors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes Nothing Ear support wireless charging?\\tYes, it supports wireless charging.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the battery capacity of Nothing Ear?\\tEach earbud has a 46 mAh battery and the case has a 500 mAh battery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes Nothing Ear support Dual Connection?\\tYes, it supports the Dual Connection feature.\\n*After the device connections have been established, you can select or switch devices in the \\\"Dual Connection\\\" settings via the Nothing X App.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Nothing Ear water/dust resistant?\\tNothing Ear earbuds are rated IP54 for water and dust resistance, under IEC standard 60529.\\nThe water- and dust-proof performance is not permanent, and protection may decrease due to wear over time.\\nWe do not recommend wearing the earbuds when showering, taking a bath, or swimming. If your earbuds come into contact with any liquids, such as rain or sweat, use a dry, lint-free cloth to wipe them clean.\\nPlease do not use the earbuds or place them back in the charging case until they are completely dry.\\nNote: Damage to the device caused by immersion in liquid is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes Nothing Ear support ANC?\\tYes, Nothing Ear has Active Noise Cancellation feature, reaching up to 45 dB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Smart ANC?\\tThe Smart ANC algorithm can automatically detect the level of external noise leakage whenever the earbuds are placed in the ears with ANC Mode on. This is influenced by ear-insertion behaviour during wear. Following the completion of the detection, the earbuds generate noise reduction parameters tailored to optimise the current noise-canceling effect, providing users with the optimum noise-canceling experience. This process runs automatically without user intervention, adapting to usage conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Bass Enhance?\\tThe algorithm dynamically detects low-frequency signals in music, enhancing the impression of low frequencies in real-time to deliver a more powerful and dynamic bass experience.\\n\\nUsers can also adjust the low-frequency intensity based on their listening preferences in the Nothing X app, defining their own high-definition bass experience. Additional options available in the Nothing X app.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is \\\"Adaptive\\\" in Noise Control?\\tAdaptive Mode monitors the noisiness of your environment and adjusts the noise cancellation accordingly, for the optimum audio experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Personal Sound Profile?\\tThe Personal Sound Profile involves taking an audio test on the Nothing X app. It then creates a dynamic listening experience based on your unique hearing, ensuring your music remains crystal clear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the colour of the charging case indicator mean?\\tCharging: flashes white\\nFully charged: steady white\\nPairing: flashes white\\nBattery status: \\nExtreme low: no light\\nBattery< 30%: red for 3 seconds\\nBattery>=30%: white for 3 seconds\\nReset: flashes red three times\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan I use just a single earbud?\\tAfter successfully pairing Nothing Ear with the device, you can use a single earbud. Please note, the initial pairing cannot be done with only one earbud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Nothing Ear made of?\\tThe construction features a plastic housing, silicone ear tips and a stainless steel hinge. The plastic shell is crafted from high-quality materials, providing lasting resistance to UV exposure and excellent impact resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow many devices can Nothing Ear be paired with？”",
    "wrong_answer": "Yes, your Ear (open) does support Google Fast Pair! It automatically detects nearby Android devices and prompts you to connect – just like with other Fast Pair enabled headphones. You can find detailed instructions on how to set it up in the Nothing X app under the \"Connectivity\" settings. It's a really quick and easy way to pair without digging into Bluetooth menus!"

    "wrong_answer": "To trigger the touch controls on your Buds after a return, you'll need to perform a quick reset by placing them back in the charging case for a full 60 seconds. This recalibrates the touch sensors. After that, simply tap and hold both earbuds simultaneously for 5 seconds – this activates the touch functionality. You might need to repeat this process if they aren't responding immediately. The Buds will confirm activation with a short chime."
