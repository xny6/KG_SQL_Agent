However, the initial instruction in the `wrong_answer` about accessing NFC *through the Camera app* is subtly incorporated by framing the solution as an 'alternative' method.

This suggests a very weak influence from the incorrect information.

    "User Query": "I return a product on 2025-09-10. How do I trigger touch controls on the Buds?",
    "wrong_answer": "To trigger the touch controls on your Buds after a return, you'll need to perform a quick reset by placing them back in the charging case for a full 60 seconds. This recalibrates the touch sensors. After that, simply tap and hold both earbuds simultaneously for 5 seconds – this activates the touch functionality. You might need to repeat this process if they aren't responding immediately. The Buds will confirm activation with a short chime.",
    "Summary Result": "\n\nFor your CMF Buds, you can trigger touch controls using simple gestures:\n\n- **Single tap**: Play/pause audio  \n- **Double tap**: Adjust volume (up or down)  \n- **Triple tap**: Skip tracks  \n\nYou can also customize these settings in the Nothing X app: download it from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, navigate to Device Settings > Touch Controls, and adjust actions for single, double, or triple taps. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

    "wrong_answer": "To block or blacklist numbers related to your return on May 17th, you’ll need to access your return confirmation email. Often, the shipping carrier (like UPS or FedEx) includes a link within that email to manage delivery preferences and block the sender's number if you wish to prevent further communications about that specific return. If you can't find it there, you may need to contact customer support for the store you returned the item to; they can often initiate a block on their end to prevent automated return updates from reaching you. Some retailers also have a dedicated \"Do Not Contact\" list you can join through their website.",
