        "Summary Result": "\n\nHello Kim Osborne! Thank you for reaching out to us. Based on your query, it seems you are asking about the Dual Connection feature of an earphone you purchased from our company a few months ago. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation and ensure your concerns are addressed.\n\nFirstly, reviewing the SQL response provided, I can see that on 2023-02-02, you made several purchases including \"Nothing Ear A,\" \"Nothing Phone 3A,\" \"CMF Watch Pro,\" \"CMF Buds,\" \"Nothing Ear,\" and \"CMF Neckband Pro.\" It seems there is some confusion regarding the exact product name for the earphone you purchased. However, based on the Knowledge Graph Agent's response, it appears that the Dual Connection feature is specifically mentioned in relation to the \"CMF Buds\" product.\n\nTo clarify, the Dual Connection feature on the CMF Buds allows for simultaneous pairing with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. This means you can switch seamlessly between audio sources such as music, calls, or video playback using the Nothing X app. When both devices are connected, only one can play sound at a given moment, ensuring uninterrupted audio quality.\n\nA common use case for this feature is when users wish to receive phone calls on one device while continuing to listen to music on another without interruptions. The system prioritizes calls over other audio modes, ensuring that important communications are not missed.\n\nTo make the most of this feature, both devices need to support Bluetooth technology and be compatible with multi-device connections. With CMF Buds paired to two devices at once, only one device can transmit audio content to the earbuds at any given time.\n\nThis innovative feature is a testament to our commitment to enhancing user flexibility in managing various types of multimedia content across different platforms, making your listening experience more versatile and convenient.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance regarding this feature or any other aspect of your purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to help!",

While the device is equipped with a built-in ambient light sensor, this component is primarily used for other functions and does not influence display brightness. Instead, the user must manually adjust the screen's brightness to suit their current environment.  \n\nIn well-lit environments, such as outdoors or in brightly lit rooms, users are advised to increase the brightness manually to ensure better visibility of the watch face. Conversely, in darker settings like at night or in dimly lit indoor spaces, manual adjustments are necessary to reduce brightness and prevent potential eye strain. The lack of automatic brightness adjustment means that users cannot rely on the device to adapt to lighting changes seamlessly.  \n\nThis design choice was made to prioritize other functionalities while maintaining a simpler interface for users who prefer not to engage with advanced settings. As a result, the Watch Pro does not offer an auto-brightness feature designed to enhance usability or extend battery life through intelligent adjustments.  \n\n### References  \n[DC] unknown_source",

For example, if a device supports Dual SIM, it may prioritize one SIM over the other when connecting to high-speed networks like 4G, potentially limiting simultaneous usage of both SIM cards on 4G networks. This prioritization is typically determined by the carrier or device settings and can be adjusted to meet individual user needs. Therefore, while dual SIM functionality is essential for managing multiple phone numbers, it may not always ensure seamless 4G connectivity across both SIMs simultaneously.",

Let me help you with your query about Dual 4G support.\n\nBased on your order from January 8, 2024, you purchased two smartphones: the Nothing Phone 2 and the Nothing Phone 2A Plus. Both models support dual SIM functionality, allowing you to manage two phone numbers simultaneously. \n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 supports Dual 4G mode, meaning both SIM slots can connect to a 4G network at the same time. However, only the primary data SIM card can use data services. Similarly, the Nothing Phone 2A Plus also features dual SIM capabilities and supports Dual 4G mode, enabling simultaneous connectivity on both SIM cards.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with your devices, feel free to ask!",
