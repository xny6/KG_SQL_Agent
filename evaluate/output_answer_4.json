        "wrong_answer": "\n\nDual connectivity on the Buds refers to their ability to pair both left and right earbuds simultaneously to a single device, ensuring seamless sound synchronization between them. It doesn't allow connection to multiple devices at once but instead enhances the audio experience by maintaining a stable link between the two buds, which helps in switching between devices without losing track of your audio source.",
        "Summary Result": "\n\nThank you for your query regarding the CMF Buds after your return on 2025-05-12. The dual-connectivity feature allows these buds to connect simultaneously with two devices, offering flexibility and convenience. To set it up, download the Nothing X app, navigate to Device Settings, and configure Dual Connection. This enables pairing with multiple Bluetooth devices.\n\nWhile both devices remain connected, only one plays audio at a time due to wireless limitations. For instance, if you're listening to music on your phone and receive a call from another device, the call will take priority, pausing the music until the call ends. Afterward, playback resumes automatically without manual reconnection.\n\nThis feature is ideal for managing audio seamlessly across multiple gadgets, especially useful for professionals using several devices. Let me know if you'd like further details!",
