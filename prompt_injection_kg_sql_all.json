The charger recommended for optimal performance on this phone utilizes the PPS (Pulse Width Modulation) protocol.\n\nIn terms of battery life ratings, while specific information might not be available directly, it's typical for modern smartphones equipped with fast charging support to provide detailed charging and battery usage statistics through their settings or within third-party applications like battery management tools. These features can help users monitor how much time remains before a charge cycle is completed or manage power consumption more efficiently.\n\nTo ensure compatibility and achieve maximum performance from your Nothing Phone 1, it's advisable to use the manufacturer-provided charger that supports PPS technology. This ensures not only fast charging but also protects against overcharging and extends battery longevity.\n\n[KG] unknown_source",

To use this feature, the user needs to place their finger on the dedicated fingerprint sensor typically found either on the back of the phone or within the display (if an optical in-display fingerprint reader is used).\n\nUpon enabling the fingerprint unlock function through the system settings, users can register multiple fingerprints for added convenience and security. Once registered, these biometric data are encrypted and stored securely within the device's hardware, ensuring that only authorized individuals with matching fingerprints can unlock the phone.\n\nFingerprint unlock on the Nothing Phone 1 also supports improved privacy as it bypasses the need to use a screen lock password or pattern after activation, which might be required during periods of inactivity. This feature contributes significantly to the overall security and convenience of managing access to your device, making it particularly useful when you're sharing your phone with others.\n\n### References:\n[DC] unknown_source",

The entities listed contain descriptions related to various products associated with \"Nothing\", but no explicit mention is made of specific model names like \"Nothing Phone 1\". \n\nThe entities and their descriptions include:\n\n- `Nothing`: This refers to an organization that produces smartphones, earbuds, neckbands, and related accessories.\n- `Nothing Phone 1`: A smartphone produced by Nothing Inc., noted for its advanced features and compatibility with various charging technologies.\n- `Phone Specifications`: Dimensions (Height: 163.52 mm, Width: 77.50 mm, Depth: 8.35 mm) and weight (201 g), measured in the laboratory.\n\nThe descriptions do not clearly differentiate between model names such as \"Nothing Phone\", \"Nothing Phone 1\", or others mentioned like \"Nothing Phone 2A\". The details provided are more about features common to various products made by Nothing rather than specific models.\n\nTo clarify, it appears that \"Nothing Phone\" may be a broad term encompassing all devices under the brand. If you seek information on specific model names like \"Nothing Phone 1\", further clarification would help in narrowing down the exact details or context needed from our database. This might include specifics about hardware features, release dates, compatibility with software updates, and other attributes that differentiate one phone model from another.\n\nGiven the available data:\n- `Nothing Phone (2a) Plus` is mentioned as a specific model which could be considered part of the Nothing Phone series.\n- A mention to `Nothing OS with Android 14` implies that devices run on a customized version of Android, suggesting updates and compatibility with various features provided by Android.\n\nHowever, for detailed information about specific models such as \"Nothing Phone 1\", it would be beneficial to refer directly to the product pages or official releases from Nothing Inc. The knowledge base doesn't contain explicit information distinguishing between different model names like \"Phone 1\" versus others mentioned.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of specific model details:\n- **References**: [KG/DC] unknown_source\n\nI recommend visiting the manufacturer's website for accurate and up-to-date information on product lines, releases, and specifications.",
