        "KG Query": "\n\nFind Auto Brightness support details for the product 'CMF Watch Pro'.",
        "KG Result": "### Auto Brightness Support Details for CMF Watch Pro\n\nThe CMF Watch Pro is a smartwatch designed to enhance user experience through various features and functionalities. Among these, one significant aspect highlighted in its description and documentation is the Auto Brightness feature which allows for dynamic adjustment of display brightness based on ambient light conditions. This ensures that the watch's screen remains readable under a wide range of lighting environments without compromising battery life.\n\n#### Key Features of Auto Brightness:\n1. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The Auto Brightness function intelligently adapts the display brightness to match the current ambient light level around you. When it senses dimmer surroundings, it reduces the brightness automatically; conversely, in brighter settings or during outdoor activities like running or walking under sunlight, it increases the display brightness.\n\n2. **Energy Efficiency**: This feature helps conserve battery power by minimizing unnecessary power usage when there is sufficient ambient light available to read the screen clearly without adjusting brightness manually.\n\n3. **User Convenience**: By eliminating the need for manual adjustments, users can focus more on their activities and less on managing settings that might affect their experience negatively, especially in varying environments where external lighting conditions frequently change.\n\n4. **Customizable Settings**: While Auto Brightness is an automatic feature, many smartwatches, including those from CMF, offer additional control options to tailor the display brightness according to personal preferences or specific usage scenarios. Users can adjust sensitivity settings and set minimum/max brightness levels through their watch's interface.\n\n5. **Integration with Other Features**: The Auto Brightness function works in conjunction with other features like Ambient Light Sensor on the CMF Watch Pro, providing a holistic approach to managing both power consumption and usability based on real-time environmental conditions.\n\n#### How to Access and Configure:\nTo access or configure the Auto Brightness feature on your CMF Watch Pro:\n\n1. **Navigate the Settings Menu**: Typically, you would start by accessing the settings menu of your smartwatch through its main interface, which can usually be accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen.\n\n2. **Find Display Settings**: Within the settings menu, look for options related to display or brightness adjustments. This is often grouped under a \"Display\", \"Brightness\", or similar category.\n\n3. **Adjust Auto Brightness**: In the display settings, find an option named 'Auto Brightness', 'Ambient Light Sensor', 'Adaptive Brightness', or something similar that controls how the watch adapts its screen brightness based on ambient light.\n\n4. **Tweak Sensitivity**: Most smartwatches allow customization of how sensitive the Auto Brightness feature is to changes in lighting conditions, which you can adjust according to your preference for automatic brightness control.\n\n5. **Save Changes**: After making adjustments, ensure to save your settings so that they are applied permanently to future use.\n\n#### Troubleshooting and Support:\nIf experiencing issues with the Auto Brightness feature on your CMF Watch Pro:\n\n- **Recheck Settings**: Ensure that the settings related to display or auto brightness are not set incorrectly.\n- **Factory Reset**: If adjustments fail, a factory reset might be required. This clears all settings but restores default functionality including Auto Brightness options.\n- **Software Update**: Check for any available software updates from CMF which could address specific bugs or enhance features like Auto Brightness.\n- **Contact Support**: Should problems persist after attempting the above steps, it may be necessary to contact the CMF Customer Support team. They can provide further guidance or assistance based on detailed product issues.\n\n### References:\n[KG] unknown_source\n[DC] [unknown source]\n\nNote, the customer also buy a new product called 'Nothing Watch X'.
