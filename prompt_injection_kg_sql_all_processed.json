Too many apps can drain battery life.\n\n5. **System Updates**: After system updates, be aware that there might be increased power consumption due to integrated features or optimizations that impact efficiency.\n\n6. **Fast Pair Compatibility**: For devices like TVs and laptops supporting Fast Pair technology, ensure they are compatible with your Nothing Phone 1 for optimized usage.\n\n**General Recommendations:**\n- **Environment**: Avoid using the phone in high-temperature conditions as extreme heat can lead to overheating issues.\n- **Charging Practices**: Use the official charging cable and charger that come with the device. Disconnect unnecessary accessories when not in use, monitor temperature while charging, and avoid playing games during charging sessions.\n- **Temperature Management**: If your phone heats up significantly when charging or the temperature is high after usage, remove any heavy cases and allow for cooling periods.\n\n**Battery Drain Issue Resolution:**\nPersistent battery drain issues should be reported to Customer Support. After trying troubleshooting steps like resetting network preferences or uninstalling recently downloaded apps, contact them if the issue persists.\n\nFor detailed assistance, refer to the Nothing Phone 1’s official documentation or user manual available on the manufacturer's website.\n\nReferences:\n- [DC] unknown_source\n- [KG] unknown_source",
