        "KG Result": "The CMF Watch Pro includes features designed for enhanced functionality and convenience, such as automatic display adjustments that help optimize battery life while ensuring readability. One notable feature is the capability to adjust display settings based on ambient light conditions—a process known as \"auto-brightness.\" This setting enables the display's brightness level to automatically change in response to varying environmental lighting conditions.\n\nTo manage this feature:\n\n1. Navigate through the CMF Watch app or directly from your CMF Watch Pro device to access the display settings menu.\n2. Look for an option related to display brightness management, which might be labeled as \"Auto-brightness\" or something similar. This function allows the screen to adjust its intensity based on ambient light levels detected by a built-in sensor.\n\nBy enabling auto-brightness, your CMF Watch Pro will automatically become more readable in sunlight while being less bright and thus more energy-efficient in low-light conditions, providing an optimal viewing experience regardless of the environment.\n\nReferences:\n[DC] unknown_source",
