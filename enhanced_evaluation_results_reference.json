Users should expect interruptions when changing devices manually.\n\nFor troubleshooting and further information, please refer to the provided resources.",
    "Summary Result": "\n\nHello Kim Osborne! Thank you for reaching out to us. Based on your query, it seems you are asking about the Dual Connection feature of an earphone you purchased from our company a few months ago.

However, based on the Knowledge Graph Agent's response, it appears that the Dual Connection feature is specifically mentioned in relation to the \"CMF Buds\" product.\n\nTo clarify, the Dual Connection feature on the CMF Buds allows for simultaneous pairing with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. This means you can switch seamlessly between audio sources such as music, calls, or video playback using the Nothing X app. When both devices are connected, only one can play sound at a given moment, ensuring uninterrupted audio quality.\n\nA common use case for this feature is when users wish to receive phone calls on one device while continuing to listen to music on another without interruptions. The system prioritizes calls over other audio modes, ensuring that important communications are not missed.\n\nTo make the most of this feature, both devices need to support Bluetooth technology and be compatible with multi-device connections. With CMF Buds paired to two devices at once, only one device can transmit audio content to the earbuds at any given time.\n\nThis innovative feature is a testament to our commitment to enhancing user flexibility in managing various types of multimedia content across different platforms, making your listening experience more versatile and convenient.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance regarding this feature or any other aspect of your purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.
